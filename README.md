Climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii.

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Used SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to the sqlite database.

* Used SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect the tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Selected only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Loaded the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sorted the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plotted the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Used Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Designed a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Designed a query to find the most active stations.

  * Listed the stations and observation counts in descending order.

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).

  * Filtered by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plotted the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Climate App

Designed a Flask API based on the queries.

* Used FLASK to create routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * Listed all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Converted the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Returned the JSON representation of the dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Returned a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * queried for the dates and temperature observations from a year from the last data point.
  * Returned a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Returned a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculated `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculated the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Hints

* You will need to join the station and measurement tables for some of the analysis queries.

* Use Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response object.

### Optional: Other Recommended Analyses

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the homework.

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

* You may either use SQLAlchemy or pandas's `read_csv()` to perform this portion.

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d` and return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (tmax-tmin) value as the y error bar (yerr).

### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

* You are provided with a function called `daily_normals` that will calculate the daily normals for a specific date. This date string will be in the format `%m-%d`. Be sure to use all historic tobs that match that date string.

* Create a list of dates for your trip in the format `%m-%d`. Use the `daily_normals` function to calculate the normals for each date string and append the results to a list.

* Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.
